Find out about recent service changes and what will be worked on in the first half of the 2021 to 2022 recruitment cycle.

## Changes for candidates

Recent changes include:

- improving the search function on ‘Find postgraduate teacher training’, making it easier to return situation specific results
- improved the Department for Education’s (DfE) ability to manage duplicate candidate accounts

Now working on:

- understanding the need for improved functionality in ‘Find postgraduate teacher training’, such as letting candidates save courses
- providing tailored content to candidates who have already engaged with a teacher training adviser
- enabling candidates to apply again with 3 choices at the same time, rather than individually
- drafting new email content for candidates who are struggling with aspects of their application, for example getting references

## Changes for providers

Recent changes include:

- introducing a new report to enable providers to view the status of active applications to each course in the current recruitment cycle
- improving the layout of the application to make it easier for providers to check what qualifications candidates have
- launching the online chat facility to enable providers to get in touch with DfE support agents quickly
- monthly reports to help users understand the current state of the initial teacher training market

Now working on:

- introducing a report to help providers understand the sex, ethnicity, disability and age of their candidates
- helping providers to better understand a candidate’s fee status and visa eligibility
- making it easier for providers to find and track applications
- improving functionality which lets providers choose which email notifications they receive from ‘Manage teacher training applications’
- making it easier for providers to give feedback to unsuccessful candidates
- letting providers change the course that the candidate applied for before making an offer
- improvements to the application programming interface (API) that allow users of student record systems to use features such as interviews, notes, deferrals and withdrawals at the candidate’s request
