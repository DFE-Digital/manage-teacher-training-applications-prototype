title: How user and organisation permissions affect each other
---

All users can view applications to their courses.

If they’re given the appropriate user permissions, they can also:

- manage interviews
- manage users - this includes adding users and setting their permissions
- manage organisations - this includes setting organisation permissions

## User permissions which are affected by organisation permissions

Users can be given user permissions to:

- make offers and reject applications
- view criminal record and professional misconduct information
- view sex, disability and ethnicity information

For courses run with partner organisations, these user permissions are affected by organisation permissions.

For example, a user will only be able to make an offer if both:

- the user has the user permission to make offers and reject applications
- the user’s organisation has the organisation permission to make offers and reject applications for courses they run with the partner organisation

There are no organisation permissions for courses run without partner organisations, so users need only the appropriate user permissions.

## Checking user and organisation permissions

You can check [your user permissions](/account/permissions) in ‘your account’.

If you run courses with partner organisations, you can check [organisation permissions](/organisation-settings/ec8968fc-ca66-41a4-946b-9e1dc7633d64/organisational-permissions) in ‘organisation settings’.

You can check [who has permission to manage users and organisations](/organisation-settings/ec8968fc-ca66-41a4-946b-9e1dc7633d64/users) in the ‘users’ section of ‘organisation settings’.
