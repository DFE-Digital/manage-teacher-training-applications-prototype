title: How user and organisation permissions affect each other
---

All users can view applications to their courses.

If they have the appropriate user permissions, they can also:

- manage interviews
- manage users - this includes adding users and setting user permissions
- manage organisations - this includes setting organisation permissions

These user permissions are not affected by organisation permissions.

## User permissions which are affected by organisation permissions

Users can have the user permissions to:

- make offers and reject applications
- view criminal record and professional misconduct information
- view sex, disability and ethnicity information

These user permissions are affected by organisation permissions for courses run with partner organisations.

For example, a user will only be able to make an offer if both:

- the user has the user permission to make offers and reject applications
- the userâ€™s organisation has the organisation permission to make offers and reject applications for courses they run with the partner organisation

There are no organisation permissions for courses run without partner organisations. Users need only the appropriate user permissions.

## Checking user and organisation permissions

You can check:

- [your user permissions](/account/permissions)
- [user permissions for everyone in your organisations](/organisation-settings) - this shows who has permission to manage users and organisations
- [organisation permissions](/organisation-settings) - if you run courses with partner organisations
