title: Zendesk chat privacy notice for manage teacher training providers
---

We are the Department for Education (DfE), 20 Great Smith St, London SW1P 3BT. We are the Data Controller for your personal data.

This privacy notice about Zendesk Chat sets out:

- why we collect your personal data
- what lawful basis we’re relying on to process your personal data
- what rights you have under the lawful basis we’re relying on
- how we protect your personal data

We use Zendesk software to store and process this data. This means that Zendesk is our Data Processor. Zendesk is required to process and protect your personal data under strict conditions, which are stated in a written agreement between Zendesk and the DfE as required by the UK GDPR and UK Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA2018).

## The lawful basis for processing your personal data

Under the data protection legislation we need a lawful basis for processing your personal data.

The lawful basis we are relying on is Public Interest.

## The personal data we collect in Zendesk Chat

Zendesk is the customer service management system we use to manage all our support requests, including Zendesk Chat and some sources of feedback. In order for you to access tailored support via Zendesk Chat, the following data is collected:

- name
- email address
- IP address
- country and city associated with the IP address
- browser and version information
- device type

In order for us to investigate and respond to your support request, it’s also possible that we will ask you for additional information. For example:

- additional personal data
- your phone number
- where you work
- your role
- candidate application details
- additional information obtained from the candidate

Do not enter any personal data into the chat unless we specifically ask you for it.

## How we use your data

### Responding to your Chat Support request

The primary purpose of Chat Support is to respond to Teacher Training Providers requests for help when managing Teacher Training applications. The data submitted through the Chat Support will therefore be used for that purpose.

### Getting insight to improve our products and services

We will also analyse and consolidate data from Support requests in order to help us understand where we can improve both the Manage product and our Support services.

## How we protect your data

We host our services on GOV.UK Government Platform as a Service (PaaS), an accredited secure government service.

The Zendesk Customer Service Platform is hosted in accordance with its [Regional Data Hosting policy](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022185194?_ga=2.9135733.1989263323.1628099773-531922291.1627980374). This means that whilst the majority of your personal data will be hosted in AWS within the European Economic Area (EEA), Zendesk will also process some of your personal data outside of the EEA, this will be in compliance with their obligation under the GDPR as Data Processor.

## How long we keep your data

We keep your data for only as long as needed for the uses listed above. For some users considering applying for Teacher Training we will need to provide support many years after first getting in touch. As such, we will delete the data we hold on you after 3 years.

## Your rights

Under the Data Protection Act 2018 and UK GDPR and the lawful basis of Public Interest, you have the following rights:

- finding out what data we hold about you
- be informed about how your data is being used
- access personal data
- have incorrect data updated
- object to how your data is processed
- restrict the processing of your data in certain circumstance
- object to direct marketing
- object to automated decision making.

Please ensure that you do not include any personal or sensitive data in the content of the Chat.

You can find more information about how we handle personal data in our [personal information charter](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education/about/personal-information-charter).

## Getting help and raising a concern

If you have any concerns or queries you can email us in the first instance at:

becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk

If we can’t resolve your issue or query, you have the right to raise it with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). You can visit their website here: Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).

## Keeping our privacy policy up to date

We will update this privacy notice  as required. Please review the privacy notice from time to time for any updates.
