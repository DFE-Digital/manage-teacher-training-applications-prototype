        <p class="govuk-body">You might benefit from extra support if you’re disabled, have a mental health condition or educational needs.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If you choose to tell us you need support, we’ll let your training provider know. They can then make adjustments so you can attend an interview or do the training.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Examples of support could be:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>organising equipment like a hearing loop or an adapted keyboard</li>
  <li>putting you in touch with support staff if you have a mental health condition</li>
  <li>making sure classrooms are wheelchair accessible</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">If the help you need is not covered by your provider making adjustments, you might also be able to get support from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work">Access to Work</a>. This could include a grant to help cover the costs of practical support in the workplace.</p>

  <li>your criminal record in the UK (they'll do an enhanced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about#dbs-checks">DBS check)</a> and abroad where relevant</li>
  <li>whether you’ve been banned from teaching or working with children</li>
  <li>your professional behaviour, such as whether you’ve been removed from teacher training and what your referees say about you</li>

    <li>School-based (for example, a teacher at a school where you’ve volunteered or gained experience)</li>
    <li>Character (choose a responsible person who can confirm you’re suitable for teaching – for example, a sports coach – and remember that training providers will only accept character references if there’s also an academic or professional reference)</li>
