        Introduction
      </h2>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-1-1">Background</h3>
      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">What is Apply for teacher training?</h4>
      <p>Apply for teacher training is a new service designed by the Department for Education (DfE).</p>
      <p>It will replace UCAS Teacher Training as the new route into initial teacher training.</p>
      <p>Apply for teacher training and the data processing activities described in this document operate under the Secretary of State for Education’s ministerial common law powers.</p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Why is DfE developing this service?</h4>
      <p>DfE research showed that teacher training candidates and training providers find the current application and selection process difficult.</p>
      <p>DfE is trying to reduce the number of people dropping out of applying for teacher training by building a new application process.</p>
      <p>Apply for teacher training will eventually share data with approximately 2,000 teacher training providers.</p>
      <p>DfE is trialling the service with selected teacher training providers. The trial will help DfE improve the service and inform government policy relating to teacher retention and recruitment.</p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Why do we need this data sharing agreement?</h4>
      <p>To run this service, DfE and teacher training providers need to share personal data. This includes sharing the data of:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>teacher training applicants</li>
        <li>staff processing applications (within DfE/within the teacher training organisation)</li>
        <li>candidates’ referees</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This data sharing agreement sets out DfE’s and the provider’s responsibilities when looking after this personal data.</p>

        <span class="govuk-caption-l">Section 2</span>
        What personal data DfE and the provider process/share and why
      </h2>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-2-1">What data DfE and the provider will process/share</h3>
      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Candidates</h4>
      <p>DfE and the provider will process and share some information about candidates including their:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>name</li>
        <li>address</li>
        <li>date of birth</li>
        <li>phone number</li>
        <li>email address</li>
        <li>any other personal/special category data that they choose to include in their application form (such as whether they’re disabled)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>DfE will also get information from the provider about candidates, such as:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>whether candidates were successful in their application (as well as the reasons why/why not)</li>
        <li>whether candidates met their conditions (including passing an enhanced DBS check)</li>
        <li>whether candidates enrolled</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Referees</h4>
      <p>DfE and the provider will process and share some information about referees so that references can be processed. This includes their:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>name</li>
        <li>email address</li>
        <li>relationship to the candidate</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Staff</h4>
      <p>DfE and the provider may also share the names and contact details of relevant staff within DfE/within the teacher training organisation so that applications can be processed.</p>
      <p>It is the provider’s responsibility to communicate this to relevant staff within their organisation.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-2-2">What the provider can use personal data for</h3>
      <p>The provider can use data to process teacher training applications in the ways outlined by this data sharing agreement.</p>
      <p>Processing teacher training applications for the provider means:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>getting in touch with a candidate about their application/the information they submitted - for example, to ask if a candidate needs reasonable adjustments to attend an interview</li>
        <li>getting in touch with referees/candidates/relevant DfE staff if there has been a data security issue</li>
        <li>making decisions on applications</li>
        <li>getting statistics for internal use</li>
        <li>contacting relevant staff at DfE if necessary to process an application</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-2-3">What DfE can use personal data for</h3>
      <p>DfE can use data to process teacher training applications, build a better teacher training application process and get insight to inform government policy.</p>
      <p>This includes (but may not be limited to):</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>processing funding/bursary payments</li>
        <li>analysing teacher training applications</li>
        <li>analysing feedback from candidates and providers</li>
        <li>getting in touch with candidates regarding their application</li>
        <li>getting in touch with provider staff, candidates or referees if there has been a data security issue</li>
        <li>getting in touch with relevant staff within the teacher training organisation, if necessary, to process an application</li>
      </ul>
      <p>DfE will also share some of the data it collects through Apply for teacher training with UCAS. This is so that DfE can:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>ensure candidates are using the two services according to DfE/UCAS policies, and contact candidates if they accept offers on both services</li>
        <li>allow DfE/UCAS to see how many people are applying for teacher training across UCAS and Apply for teacher training, in order to carry out statistical analysis</li>
      </ul>

      </h2>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-3-1">Lawful conditions for sharing/<wbr>processing personal data</h3>
      <p>Apply for teacher training and the data processing activities described in this document operate under the Secretary of State for Education’s Ministerial common law powers.</p>
      <p>Apply for teacher training is in the public interest, as outlined under the following legislation:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Article 6(1)(e) and Article 9(2)(g) of the General Data Protection Regulation</li>
        <li>Section 8 of the Data Protection Act 2018</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-3-2">The right to respect for private and family life</h3>
      <p>Participants will not be asked to share information related to their private or family lives.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-3-3">Privacy notices</h3>
      <p>Please see the <a href="/provider/privacy-policy">Apply for teacher training privacy policy for candidates, referees and provider staff</a>.</p>
      <p>DfE will make data subjects aware of how their data will be processed before data is collected through Apply for teacher training.</p>
      <p>Please see DfE’s Personal Information Charter for more details on the organisation’s data storage and sharing policies.</p>
      <p>By agreeing to this data sharing agreement, DfE and the provider confirm that their respective privacy policies explain the data sharing activities outlined in this agreement.</p>
      <p>Privacy policies should outline the purposes of processing data, and the lawful basis for doing so.</p>

        <span class="govuk-caption-l">Section 2</span>
        Data handling
      </h2>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-4-1">Process and systems used for sharing data</h3>
      <p>DfE and the provider are joint data controllers for the data collected through Apply for teacher training.</p>
      <p>DfE gives the provider access to the data through a digital service that allows providers to log in securely.</p>
      <p>Later on in the trial of the service, DfE will give relevant providers access to data through API systems which integrate with providers’ student record systems.</p>
      <p>DfE uses Zendesk, a customer relationship management system, to handle queries from providers. Zendesk uses various safeguards to look after data.</p>
      <p>DfE may also use G Suite to collect and share information, such as references, with the provider.</p>
      <p>DfE and the provider may also share some data through other channels, such as by phone or email.</p>
      <p>Refer to section on ‘Third party disclosure’ for more information on how DfE shares data.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-4-2">Accuracy of the shared data</h3>
      <p>DfE undertakes to ensure that the data given to the provider accurately reflects the information given to DfE, though the format may be different.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-4-3">Assurance of compliance</h3>
      <p>DfE’s Personal Information Charter explains the standards expected of DfE when holding personal information.</p>
      <p>By signing this agreement, the provider confirms that:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>their organisation is compliant with GDPR</li>
        <li>data will be held in secure systems in line with data protection legislation</li>
        <li>data will be held for only as long as needed for the purposes outlined in this agreement, and destroyed when no longer needed</li>
        <li>they will comply with the security requirements for holding official data</li>
        <li>it’s in the interest of both parties to comply with data protection legislation (to protect people’s rights and minimise data processing risks, such as reputational damage)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-4-4">Third party disclosure</h3>
      <p>Within DfE, access to data will be restricted to teams that need it for processing applications, building a better teacher training application and getting insight to inform government policy.</p>
      <p>DfE uses some third-party data processors, including Google Analytics, G Suite, Zendesk and Microsoft Azure.</p>
      <p>Providers must follow guidance from the Information Commissioner’s Office on appointing and using appropriate data processors.</p>
      <p>It is the provider’s responsibility to ensure that data subjects know who processes data on their behalf and under what legal authority.</p>
      <p>By signing this agreement, the provider confirms that:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>their data sharing practices comply with data protection legislation</li>
        <li>their data sharing practices minimise the risk of individuals being identified by unauthorised parties, using appropriate safeguards to look after shared data</li>
        <li>they will only share data for the purposes outlined in this agreement</li>
        <li>they hold data in strict confidence and have appropriate safeguards in place to protect data against unlawful or unauthorised processing</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-4-5">Handling subject access requests (SARs)</h3>
      <p>DfE will manage SARs regarding any information DfE holds.</p>
      <p>DfE and the provider will contact each other immediately if they get a request for:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>rectification of information (Article 16 of GDPR)</li>
        <li>erasure of information (Article 17 of GDPR)</li>
        <li>restriction to process information (Article 18 of GDPR)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For other types of SAR, the provider must notify DFE within 5 working days.</p>
      <p>Data subjects wanting to make a SAR can email DfE at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk">becomingateacher<wbr>@digital.education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-4-6">Handling Freedom of Information Act Requests</h3>
      <p>DfE takes responsibility for responding to Freedom of Information Act Requests regarding Apply for teacher training data processing/sharing practices.</p>
      <p>DfE will contact the provider if any support is needed to process a request.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-4-7">Data storage</h3>
      <p>The provider must store shared data securely.</p>
      <p>Data should be encrypted at rest, using modern, full disk encryption such as Windows BitLocker, or Linux/dm-crypt.</p>
      <p>The data must be retained in a way that is compliant with EU data protection legislation.</p>
      <p>By signing this agreement, DfE and the provider agree to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>hold data in strict confidence</li>
        <li>have appropriate safeguards in place to protect data against unlawful or unauthorised processing</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-4-8">Retention schedule </h3>
      <p>Personal data must be kept only as long as needed to carry out the activities outlined in this document.</p>
      <p>DfE will keep data for 7 years.</p>
      <p>The provider must set an appropriate time limit, in line with the General Data Protection Regulation, for retaining data before erasure or review.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-4-9">Destruction schedule</h3>
      <p>The provider should destroy the data when it is no longer needed, or when the retention schedule has expired.</p>
      <p>The provider should follow the NCSC guidance for secure sanitisation.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="section-5">

        Security breaches
      </h2>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-5-1">Security incidents</h3>
      <p>DfE and the provider are responsible for notifying each other in writing in the event of loss or unauthorised disclosure of information within 24 hours of the event being discovered.</p>
      <p>The designated points of contact will discuss and agree the next steps relating to the incident, taking specialist advice where appropriate.</p>
      <p>Such arrangements will include (but will not be limited to):</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>containing the incident and mitigating any ongoing risk</li>
        <li>recovering information</li>
        <li>assessing whether the Information Commissioner should be notified or whether data protection officers or data subjects need to be notified</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The arrangements may vary in each case, depending on the sensitivity of the information and the nature of the loss or unauthorised disclosure.</p>
      <p>Where appropriate and if relevant to the incident, disciplinary misconduct action/criminal proceedings will be considered.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="section-5-2">Consequences of security incident</h3>
      <p>Any security incident that occurs will not impact DfE’s ongoing cooperation with the provider.</p>
      <p>In the event of a personal data breach (or where there is a reason to believe that an incident could arise) DfE and the provider will delay data transfers until the signatories of this agreement are satisfied that the cause/incident is resolved.</p>
      <p>If the issue can’t be resolved or if it’s very serious, data sharing won’t start again until DfE and the provider are satisfied that the cause/incident is resolved.</p>
